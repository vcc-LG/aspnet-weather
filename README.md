# About

I was asked in a recent job interview to modify an existing ASP.NET project so that it could read in a feed of weather JSON data from [here](http://samples.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?id=524901&appid=b6907d289e10d714a6e88b30761fae22). I totally floundered and didn't even really know where to start, apart from having a basic awareness that I'd need to make a model, view, and controller!

I felt quite bad about this so I spent the following week trying to do the challenge in my spare time. The interview gave some hints to help me: I should use a service and read up on SOLID design principles.

Given that, here is my finished product. It does what it was meant to do in the technical challenge and uses a service! I'm sure an experienced developer would be able to critique my code, but for the moment I'm pleased that, even though it should have taken me an hour, a week later I finished the technical challenge.
